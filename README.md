- 👋 Hi, my name is Álvaro Maldonado, but my friends call me (jokingly) "elmandelbetis".
- 👀 I’m interested in mid-to-high level programming, software, sports, F1 and videogames.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C++, Java, Ruby and Python at university.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on several projects with my friends, as well as starting some other by myself soon
- 📫 How to reach me: for now, by my GitHub or Instagram profiles. Sooner or later I'll create a LinkedIn profile and try to start running a website somewhere.
